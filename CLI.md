# CLI Design

## Purpose
Lens is a developer tool, so the CLI is the product's primary interface, not a thin wrapper around internal APIs. The command set must be easy to remember, safe by default, and predictable across platforms.

This document describes the intended UX contract for every command without implementing any runtime behavior.

## CLI Philosophy

### Principles
- One command, one job.
- Safe defaults first, explicit escape hatches second.
- Interactive output for humans, structured output for automation.
- The same core concepts should appear everywhere: flows, messages, redaction, replay, config, and diagnostics.
- Commands should explain what they are doing when they might affect trust, privacy, or network traffic.

### Trade-offs
- A richer CLI takes more design discipline than a handful of ad hoc flags.
- Explicit commands reduce magic, but they make the behavior understandable and scriptable.
- The tool should feel calm rather than clever; that is slower to design, but easier to trust.

## Global Shape

### Command family
- `lens run`
- `lens inspect`
- `lens record`
- `lens replay`
- `lens doctor`
- `lens benchmark`
- `lens export`
- `lens config`

### Default command
- If the user runs `lens` with no subcommand, behave like `lens run`.
- Trade-off: this is convenient for interactive use, but it must be documented clearly so automation does not accidentally start a live session.

### Global options
- `--config <path>`: use a specific config file.
- `--profile <name>`: select a named config profile.
- `--json`: emit machine-readable output when the command supports it.
- `--quiet`: reduce nonessential output.
- `--verbose`: increase diagnostic detail, repeatable.
- `--no-color`: disable ANSI color.
- `--help`: print command help.
- `--version`: print the version.

### Trade-offs
- Global flags make the CLI consistent, but they must not override command-specific intent in surprising ways.
- `--json` is valuable for automation, but not every command has a useful structured form.
- `--verbose` should add context, not noise.

## Command: `lens run`

### Intent
Start the live proxy and UI for day-to-day debugging.

### Responsibilities
- Start the capture session.
- Resolve config and trust state.
- Launch the interactive TUI unless headless mode is requested.
- Forward traffic while capturing flows.
- Redact sensitive material by default.

### Suggested flags
- `--listen <addr:port>`: bind address for the proxy.
- `--mode <explicit|transparent>`: choose how traffic reaches Lens.
- `--upstream-proxy <url>`: chain to another proxy.
- `--protocols <list>`: enable specific decoders.
- `--reveal`: disable redaction after a loud warning.
- `--max-flows <n>`: cap in-memory history.
- `--max-body <bytes>`: cap captured payload size.
- `--headless`: run without the TUI.
- `--export <path>`: write captured data while the session runs.

### UX behavior
- On startup, show a short status summary: mode, listen address, redaction state, config profile, and trust state.
- If a trust-store or CA step is required, explain why before proceeding.
- If the user is in TTY mode, open the interactive flow map first.
- If the session cannot safely begin, fail early with a clear reason.

### Trade-offs
- `run` is the most powerful command, so it risks becoming overloaded.
- Keeping it the default improves discoverability, but the command must stay focused on live capture rather than turning into a generic subcommand bucket.
- Headless mode is useful for CI and long-running capture jobs, but it should not compromise the interactive story.

### Example
```text
lens run --mode explicit --listen 127.0.0.1:8888
```

## Command: `lens inspect`

### Intent
Open a specific flow, message, or export artifact and inspect it in a structured way.

### Responsibilities
- Locate a target by flow ID, request ID, selector, or file path.
- Render the request/response details with redaction preserved unless explicitly overridden.
- Let the user browse headers, metadata, bodies, and timing.

### Suggested flags
- `--flow <id>`: inspect a specific flow.
- `--message <id>`: inspect one message.
- `--source <path>`: inspect from an export file.
- `--raw`: show captured bytes with minimal normalization.
- `--reveal`: show sensitive fields after explicit confirmation.
- `--format <human|json>`: choose output mode.

### UX behavior
- Default to a human-readable inspector view.
- When the target is ambiguous, present a short selector list rather than failing silently.
- If the source is offline data, make that clear in the header.

### Trade-offs
- A dedicated inspect command keeps `run` from becoming a data browser.
- It is more work than simply opening everything inside `run`, but it provides a cleaner mental model.

### Example
```text
lens inspect --flow flow_01H... --reveal
```

## Command: `lens record`

### Intent
Capture traffic into a durable artifact for later analysis or sharing.

### Responsibilities
- Start a capture session with recording enabled.
- Write a local artifact while maintaining the live experience.
- Allow explicit limits for size, duration, and event types.

### Suggested flags
- `--output <path>`: destination artifact.
- `--format <jsonl|json|har>`: output format.
- `--duration <time>`: stop after a fixed period.
- `--until-exit`: stop when the tracked app exits.
- `--include <filters>`: limit what gets recorded.
- `--exclude <filters>`: omit selected flows or protocols.

### UX behavior
- Record should be explicit that it creates an artifact, not just a live session.
- The command should summarize what was recorded and what was omitted.
- If the file already exists, require a deliberate overwrite decision.

### Trade-offs
- Recording is useful for reproducibility, but it introduces privacy and storage concerns.
- Exporting from the live session could have been enough, but a dedicated command makes the intent obvious.

### Example
```text
lens record --output ./captures/login-flow.jsonl --format jsonl
```

## Command: `lens replay`

### Intent
Reissue a captured request or session against an upstream target.

### Responsibilities
- Load a recorded flow or request.
- Reconstruct the outgoing request in a controlled way.
- Let the user choose whether to replay exactly, mutate, or dry-run.

### Suggested flags
- `--input <path>`: source capture.
- `--flow <id>`: select a flow from a larger capture.
- `--target <url>`: override the original upstream.
- `--dry-run`: show what would be sent without sending it.
- `--repeat <n>`: replay multiple times.
- `--edit`: open a prompt or editor before sending.
- `--headers <mode>`: keep, strip, or replace sensitive headers.

### UX behavior
- Replaying should be treated as a potentially dangerous action.
- The command should warn when it can modify remote state.
- Dry-run should be the default in non-interactive or ambiguous situations.

### Trade-offs
- Replay is a high-value debugging tool, but it is also the most likely command to cause side effects.
- Requiring explicit targets and previews makes it safer, though slightly slower.

### Example
```text
lens replay --input ./captures/login-flow.jsonl --target https://staging.api.example.com --dry-run
```

## Command: `lens doctor`

### Intent
Diagnose whether the environment is ready to use Lens.

### Responsibilities
- Check config resolution.
- Validate trust store and CA state.
- Verify port availability.
- Check platform limitations.
- Report decoder and plugin availability.

### Suggested flags
- `--json`: structured diagnostics.
- `--check trust`: focus on certificate setup.
- `--check network`: focus on bind and routing readiness.
- `--check config`: focus on config resolution.
- `--check all`: run every check.

### UX behavior
- Output should be action-oriented: what is wrong, why it matters, and how to fix it.
- Warnings should be clearly separated from failures.
- If the environment is already healthy, say that plainly.

### Trade-offs
- This command adds a maintenance burden because every new subsystem needs a diagnostic path.
- The benefit is huge: users can self-serve instead of guessing at setup failures.

### Example
```text
lens doctor --check all
```

## Command: `lens benchmark`

### Intent
Measure Lens behavior and protect performance over time.

### Responsibilities
- Run built-in benchmark scenarios.
- Compare current results to a baseline when available.
- Report regression or improvement trends.

### Suggested flags
- `--suite <name>`: select a benchmark set.
- `--baseline <path>`: compare against stored results.
- `--output <path>`: write results to disk.
- `--json`: emit structured results.
- `--repeat <n>`: run multiple samples.
- `--allow-regression <pct>`: set a threshold for reporting.

### UX behavior
- Benchmark output should be stable and easy to diff.
- The command should distinguish noise from real regression.
- It should explain when results are not statistically strong enough.

### Trade-offs
- Performance tooling is essential, but it is not a first-run user workflow.
- A separate command prevents benchmark concerns from leaking into the core capture flow.

### Example
```text
lens benchmark --suite proxy-throughput --baseline ./benchmarks/baseline.json
```

## Command: `lens export`

### Intent
Turn captured data into a portable artifact for sharing, archiving, or downstream analysis.

### Responsibilities
- Export flows, messages, and metadata.
- Preserve redaction state unless reveal was explicitly requested.
- Support multiple output formats.

### Suggested flags
- `--input <path>`: source session or artifact.
- `--output <path>`: destination file.
- `--format <jsonl|json|har|csv>`: export format.
- `--flows <selector>`: limit exported flows.
- `--messages <selector>`: limit exported messages.
- `--reveal`: include sensitive fields after confirmation.
- `--pretty`: make JSON more readable.

### UX behavior
- Export should say exactly what was exported and what was excluded.
- It should refuse accidental overwrite unless the user opts in.
- If the export may contain secrets, the warning should be visible and specific.

### Trade-offs
- Export is a broad command because different users need different downstream formats.
- The benefit of one command is discoverability; the cost is keeping the format surface coherent.

### Example
```text
lens export --input ./captures/session.jsonl --format har --output ./out/session.har
```

## Command: `lens config`

### Intent
Inspect, validate, and manage Lens configuration.

### Responsibilities
- Show the resolved config.
- Explain which layer supplied each value.
- Validate config files.
- Optionally write or unset values in a controlled way.

### Suggested subcommands
- `lens config show`
- `lens config validate`
- `lens config diff`
- `lens config set`
- `lens config unset`
- `lens config path`

### Suggested flags
- `--json`: structured output.
- `--profile <name>`: inspect a specific profile.
- `--effective`: show the final merged result.
- `--source`: include provenance for each field.

### UX behavior
- The `show` command should reveal the effective config, not just one file, because precedence matters.
- `validate` should fail with the smallest useful error message possible.
- `set` and `unset` should be cautious and explicit because they modify user state.

### Trade-offs
- Config inspection is indispensable, but config mutation can become a side effect trap.
- Keeping read and write operations in the same family helps discoverability, but the subcommands must remain sharply separated.

### Example
```text
lens config show --effective --source
```

## Help Output Design

### Overall style
Help text should answer three questions fast:
- What does this command do?
- What are the most important flags?
- What is the safest example to copy first?

### Formatting rules
- Put the one-line summary immediately under the command name.
- Group flags into logical clusters: connection, capture, privacy, output, and diagnostics.
- Show defaults inline when they matter.
- Keep examples short and realistic.
- Prefer plain language over implementation jargon.

### Example structure
```text
lens run
Start a live capture session and open the TUI.

USAGE:
  lens run [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
  --mode <explicit|transparent>    How traffic reaches Lens
  --listen <addr:port>             Listen address [default: 127.0.0.1:8888]
  --reveal                         Disable redaction after warning
  --headless                       Run without the TUI

EXAMPLES:
  lens run --mode explicit
  lens run --mode transparent --listen 127.0.0.1:8888
```

### Trade-offs
- Rich help output is a maintenance cost, but it is one of the fastest ways to reduce user confusion.
- Good help text often prevents support tickets before they exist.

## Error Message Design

### Principles
- Say what failed.
- Say why it matters.
- Say how to fix it.
- Avoid blaming the user.
- Avoid stack traces in normal CLI failures.

### Preferred style
- Include the command name in the error when helpful.
- Use concrete paths, ports, and values.
- Offer the next action where possible.
- Keep redaction errors distinct from transport errors and config errors.

### Examples
- `lens run: port 8888 is already in use. Try --listen 127.0.0.1:8890.`
- `lens replay: capture file not found: ./captures/login.jsonl`
- `lens doctor: trust store installation failed. Run this command with permission to update the local CA.`
- `lens export: refusing to overwrite ./out/session.jsonl. Pass --force to replace it.`

### Trade-offs
- Friendly messages take more design work than generic ones.
- The payoff is high: the tool becomes self-explanatory in failure states, which is where most real usage happens.

## UX Safety Rules
- Redaction is on by default.
- Dangerous actions require explicit confirmation or a clear non-interactive opt-in.
- Replay should default to dry-run behavior when ambiguity exists.
- Export should never silently reveal secrets.
- Diagnostics should be more helpful than alarming.

## Examples by Workflow

### First-time user
```text
lens doctor
lens run --mode explicit --listen 127.0.0.1:8888
```

### Live debugging
```text
lens run
lens inspect --flow flow_01H...
```

### Reproducibility
```text
lens record --output ./captures/session.jsonl
lens replay --input ./captures/session.jsonl --dry-run
```

### Sharing safely
```text
lens export --input ./captures/session.jsonl --format json --output ./out/session.json
```

### Performance work
```text
lens benchmark --suite proxy-throughput
```

## Final Position
The CLI should feel like a small set of dependable verbs rather than a giant option matrix. The verbs are intentionally human: run, inspect, record, replay, doctor, benchmark, export, config. That gives the tool a stable mental model and leaves room for future growth without making the first version feel crowded.
